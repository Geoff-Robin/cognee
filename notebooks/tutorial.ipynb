    "In this comprehensive tutorial, you'll discover how to transform scattered development data into an intelligent knowledge system that enhances your coding workflow. By the end, you'll have:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Connected disparate data sources** (Guido's CPython contributions, mypy development, PEP discussions, your Python projects) into a unified AI memory graph\n",
    "- **Built an memory layer** that understands Python design philosophy, best practice coding patterns, and your preferences and experience\n",
    "- **Learn how to use intelligent search capabilities** that combine the diverse context\n",
    "- **Integrated everything with your coding environment** through MCP (Model Context Protocol)\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates the power of **knowledge graphs** and **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** for software development, showing you how to build systems that learn from Python's creator and improve your own Python development."

    "- **`cognee.cognify()`** - Processes and structures data into a knowledge graph using AI\n",

    "- **`pep_style_guide.md` ‚Äî Norms.** Encodes community style and typing conventions (PEP‚ÄØ8 and related). Ensures that search results and inferred rules align with widely accepted standards.\n",
    "- **`zen_principles.md` ‚Äî Philosophy.** The Zen of Python. Grounds design trade‚Äëoffs (simplicity, explicitness, readability) beyond syntax or mechanics.\n",
    "- **`my_developer_rules.md` ‚Äî Local constraints.** Your house rules, conventions, and project‚Äëspecific requirements (scope, privacy, Spec.md). Keeps recommendations relevant to your actual workflow.\n",
